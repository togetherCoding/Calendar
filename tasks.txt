1. make 7 vertical pushbuttons
2. add label above and button on each side                  just like   [<] text [>]
3. make new class Calendar which will derive from QWidget and will have new methods like: getCurrentDate(), changeDateRange(...), generateDateRangeString()
4. make class Event: name of event, timing (optional?), done/not done...
5. make class Day which will derive from QPushButton and will have methods like addEvent(Event)
